/// Manager for airport demand simulation and forecasting
///
/// Purpose: This class will handle dynamic airport demand calculations based on:
/// - Economic factors (GDP, tourism, business activity)
/// - Seasonal variations (summer/winter travel patterns)
/// - Competition effects (other airlines on same routes)
/// - Market events (conferences, holidays, disasters)
/// - Airport capacity constraints and congestion
///
/// Currently returns static values from airport.demand but designed for
/// future implementation of complex demand modeling algorithms.
