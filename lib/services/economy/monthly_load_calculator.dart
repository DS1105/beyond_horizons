/// Calculator for monthly passenger load factor simulation
///
/// Purpose: This class will calculate actual passenger loads and aircraft utilization including:
/// - Load factor percentages per route (actual vs. capacity)
/// - Passenger distribution across cabin classes (economy/business/first)
/// - Aircraft utilization rates (flight hours per month)
/// - Seasonal demand variations (summer peaks, winter lows)
/// - Booking patterns and no-show rates
/// - Overbooking optimization strategies
/// - Revenue management load balancing
///
/// Will consider factors like:
/// - Airport demand levels and competition
/// - Route maturity and market penetration
/// - Economic conditions affecting travel demand
/// - Special events and holidays impact
/// - Weather and operational disruptions
