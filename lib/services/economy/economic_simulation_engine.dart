/// Main economic simulation engine
///
/// Purpose: This is the central orchestrator for the "Next Month" simulation including:
/// - Coordinate all calculator classes in proper sequence
/// - Execute monthly economic cycle simulation
/// - Handle time progression and date management
/// - Manage simulation state and persistence
/// - Trigger economic events and market changes
/// - Generate monthly reports and summaries
/// - Handle random events (weather, strikes, economic shocks)
///
/// Monthly simulation workflow:
/// 1. Update airport demand levels (AirportDemandCalculator)
/// 2. Calculate route passenger loads (MonthlyLoadCalculator)
/// 3. Compute operating costs (RouteCostCalculator)
/// 4. Calculate revenue streams (RouteRevenueCalculator)
/// 5. Aggregate cashflow results (CashflowCalculator)
/// 6. Update FinanceManager with results
/// 7. Advance game date to next month
